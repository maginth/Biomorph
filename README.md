# Biomorph evolution lab

### Clone, hybrid, hack genes, control mutation intensity... 

__Feel free to explore the infinite diversity of biomorphs.__  
Biomorphs are __fractal creatures__. One of their genes is already enough for producing the famous dragon curve with a fine organic texture. An actual biomorph can count thousands of inter dependent genes without slowing down the app. 
Sometime the beauty of a biomorph lay in the fine details of its structure, you can magnify it up to __1000000 times__ with the powerful zoom.  

## App controls :

Most of the action can be performed with the mouse :  
+ drag and drop biomorph as you wish between the panels 
+ scroll to zoom, each panel is zoomable
+ double click a biomorph to center the genealogy tree on it
+ in the main view, drop biomorphs on top of each other to produce offsprings
+ middle click on a biomorph to clone it with random mutations
+ open the contextual menu of a biomorph to access its gene hacking control panel
+ each gene disk has fine mouse controls, watch the result live. 

> __when zoomed, the main view disable some control for pure exploration__

## lauching the app :

You can try double clicking biomorph.jar on windows (make sure to extract files if ziped),  
Otherwise use a terminal with the following command:  

    java -jar biomorph.jar
